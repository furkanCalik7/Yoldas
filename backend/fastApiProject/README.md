To use the backend:
- 
- set to directory "backend"
- run "pip install -r requirement.txt"
- run "uvicorn fastApiProject.main:app --reload"
- hopefully, there should be no errors

While developing:
- 
- If you installed a new library, run: pip freeze > requirements.txt
- Check if you are pushing to the correct branch
- Try not to push too many files in 1 commit
