## Project Description

"Yoldaş (Yoldas) is a non-profit mobile app that empowers visually impaired individuals to live more independently. We connect them with volunteers through live video calls, addressing a range of needs, from everyday tasks to emotional support. Our platform matches visually impaired people with volunteers with the required abilities, ensuring swift and satisfying interactions. We prioritize user experience with smart feedback mechanisms and an accessible UI. Beyond live support, Yoldas leverages AI to assist users with color recognition, currency identification, and text summarization through their smartphone cameras. We collaborate with associations for the visually impaired to ensure our solutions are practical and impactful."
